As it appears today, despite 2 millenia of attempted global ideological domestication, tribal behaviour has not been forgotten and civilisation is more than ever a subject of discussion. In parallel to the rise of digitalised behavior, we saw  financial and humanitarian atrocities trigger the most brutal attacks on critical thought. Hindered and expanded, undermined and upgraded, humanity is switching states, and during this transition, it is actualising both states at the same time. At such a scale, the ergonomic studies of today become the logical habits, the psychological limitations of tomorrow, and you will swipe to the right to answer calls for the rest of your life, whatever else that implies in your life as a global experience. In this world, we are under observation, and our caretakers are eager to define us, to model us, probably with the intention of better pleasing our natural inclinations. Whether they are natural or not, it is not certain that the inclinations which are pushed on us actually promote indiviual development, while claiming to do so. Less and less randomness, and a very cheap model of it. In this world, where we are forced to be ourselves, we need to become the other. This way only can we take full advantage of the current state of things, while rationally considering a few 10'000 years' worth of genetic evolution which was encapsulated in our DNA.

XenoXenism was implemented as the quickest path to otherness, defined in terms of evolutionary psychology. XenoXenism is defined as the access to one's own otherness, in the sense of whatever they are determined not to be, rather than whatever they can be. XenoXenism consists in taking into account determinisms active outside the realm of mediated self-conscious experience, and building the activities of the mind in accordance, generating signs of otherness along the way. Listening to one's genes means accessing version-control tools for the human mind's software: reaching into behavioral banks which have not been transmitted contextually, but do make the hardware resonate.

<br>

Listen to your genes. Do not be yourself. Become other.

(The Bible of Xenoxenism will be made public on October 7 2017.)

1-XenoXenism can be compared to Zen Buddhism in its urge to produce unfiltered behaviour in well-orchestrated contexts. 
Zen Buddhism does not explain itself as much as it casts derision upon what it perceives as uninsightful. Zen is certainly other, from the point of view of whatever is not Japanese. For this reason it is a perfect example of otherness, while displaying its core elements in an unobtrusive way. Moreover, Zen has a notion of 'otherness', which borders on the absurd: only the self-conscious mind perceives anything as being other than them. Only those who were unable to get rid of that primitive obstacle which is self-awareness believe in otherness. For this reason, becoming otherness implies reaching a particular stage in life, a unique experience in which we entirely loose track of having ever known of any border, anywhere. These points in life can be seen as insights, and depending on the definition you get of 'satori' you will be more or less willing to aspire to it. But as inspiring as it may get, being a Zen monk doesn't enable you to take full advantage of the current situation in history; or does it? 

2-It is best thought of as an MVC implementation  of Spinoza’s system (short for the Model/View/Controller pattern used in coding, as for example HTML/CSS/JavaScript). XenoXenism understands the world as a set of three layers: the infinite series of conscious selves experienced by all sentient creatures, the layout or rendering of immediate experience, and the functions at work in the social world. Each of these layers deserves proper description, as their overlapping processes should be understood as functionally differentiated. Two more items will be described: the alienated nature of human experience, and the means by which to reach Otherness, binding determinisms and randomness under the process of ritualization of spontaneity. 

3-Critical thought, recursive and skeptical
Skepticism is an ancient philosophical school which claimed that ultimate wisdom, leading to happiness, consists in breaking apart all decision processes into their eventual duality and being able to see them as equally plausible. Their moto, “ou mallon”, can be rendered as “not one rather than the other”. According to Pyrrho, psychological stability, or rather equanimity can only be reached by means of what he called suspension of judgement. The 
goal of this process can easily be compared to Zen Buddhism, which points out the absence of an actual border between things, thus making the concept of otherness futile. 

4-Ritualisation of spontaneity
Spontaneity and instinctive behaviours are understood as generators of actualised and contextualised random behaviors, more precisely non-replicable behaviours. Taking  interest in stereotyped reactions and their non-replicability enables you to perceive the absurd. Originality is as instinctive as failiure, and they both highlight the performative nature of social existence. Attempts make us who we are, and as such we can be described as a set of events. But for those who wish to escape this determinism, it is advisable to break apart from infatuated self-awareness and come to terms with reality as a flow. Producing art, in whatever way possible in all possible worlds, is always a spontaneous ritual. On the one hand, it is always impossible to meet the absolute exactitude hinted at by the ritual itself. On the other hand, each micro-variation, each step aside from the ritual itself, as lively and spontaneous as it can be, becomes ritualized as it is produced. This process coerces event types: forgetting becomes omitting, making a mistake becomes making a decision. Events are not only rationalized and coerced by the artists, they actually come accross as a spectrum of intensity which eventually reflects the current state of folk psychology. As art changes, aesthetic values follow, and the other way around. Production tools have become so popular that making art is available to more everyday. Although the public's taste shifts swiftly, some humans find the means with which to express an opinion, both dominant and precise enough to be adpoted by others. These humans are both consequences and causes of social waves, by the means of extensive exposure in the public discourse. However this is another field of interest than that of aesthetic experience, as it has more to do with algorithms and statistics. Pure non-mediated experience can occur in any context, with any level of social visibility. Ritualised experience can most easily be reached in loneliness, as it is the state where one is free to determine themselves entirely, yet the more individuals take part in a ritual, the more social value it gains. The more people agree on a particular ritual, the more spontaneity has to be ruled out, since the symbolic value is far more important than the shell that carries it: if it is rationalised in real time, any behavior becomes mystified and can thus be used as an tool of mystification..

Le XénoXénisme est une version alternative du XénoFéminisme. Il a été implémenté comme voie la plus rapide vers l’altérité, définie en termes de psychologie évolutionniste. <br> Le XénoXénisme consiste à prendre en compte et à critiquer les déterminismes enfouis au delà de l’expérience immédiate. Écoutez vos gênes. Ne soyez plus vous-même. Devenez autre.

(La Bible du XénoXénisme sera rendue publique le 7 Octobre 2017.)

1-Bouddhisme Zen
Le XénoXénisme ressemble au Bouddhisme Zen dans son engagement à produire des comportements non-filtrés dans des contextes bien orchestrés. On ne pourrait mieux le décrire que comme une implémentation MVC du système de Spinoza (acronyme du motif Modèle/Vue/Contrôleur utilisé en programmation, comme par exemple dans l’ensemble HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Le XénoXénisme comprend le monde comme un ensemble composé de trois couches: la série infinie de personnalités conscientes que toute créature sensible expérimente, l’apparence et le rendu de l’expérience immédiate et les fonctions au travail dans le monde social,. Chacune de ces couches mérite une description appropriée, car leur processus superposés doivent être compris comme fonctionnellement différenciés. Deux éléments supplémentaires seront décrits: la nature aliénée de l’expérience humaine, et les moyens pour atteindre l’Altérité, en joignant les déterminismes avec l’arbitraire sous la forme du processus de ritualisation de la spontanéité. 

3-Pensée Critique, récursivité et scepticisme
Le scepticisme est une école de philosophie Antique, qui affirme que la sagesse ultime, qui mène au bonheur, consiste à réduire tous les processus à leur dualité essentielle, tout en étant capable de les voir comme deux possibilités équivalentes. Leur devise, “ou mallon”, signifiant “pas plus l’un que l’autre”. D’après Pyrrhon d’Elis, la stabilité psychologique, ou plutôt l’état d’équanimité ne peut être atteint qu’à travers ce qu’il appelait la suspension du jugement. Le but de ce processus peut facilement être comparé au Bouddhisme Zen, qui nie l’existence d’une division nette entre les choses, ce qui rend le concept d’altérité futile.

4-Ritualisation de la Spontanéité
La spontanéité et les comportements instinctifs sont entendus en tant que générateurs de comportements arbitraires, ou plus précisément de comportements non-reproductibles.
